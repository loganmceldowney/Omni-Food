## **Project Purpose & Goal**
The purpose of creating this project was in order to become more comfortable working with HTML & CSS. This project was a part of a course I was taking on Udemy in order to learn these skills better. Therefore, by creating this website, I was able to become much more proficient at writing HTML and CSS as a whole. The main goal for creating this project was being able to create a very professional looking meal-delivery-service website that could be used to demonstrate my skills.

## **Technologies Used**
The main technologies used for this project was HTML and CSS. From an online course from Udemy, this was the main project that was associated with that course. The main idea of creating this was to become better at using HTML & CSS and learning different aspects of these technologies. For this project, it included CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, Hover effects, and much more!

## **Design & Thought Process**
Before designing this website, I wanted the user to have a very easy time navigating the website. To do this, I implemented a navigation bar at the top, and also bright colors for the buttons that need to draw the most attention. This allowed the user to be able to look around the website, and find the most important information in a very quick way.

In addition to this, the website needed to be very professional looking. To do this, the website is broken down into different sections that had a very clean feel to it. This was done by using UI/UX design principles that were taught in this course in order to create a very nice experience for the user.

Aside from that, this website was also my first view into responsive web design. This website allowed me to create something that could be used on large screens, as well as small screens very easily. Learning responsive design was a very crucial part of the course I took on Udemy, and it was very beneficial to be able to learn these topics in an interactive way.
